# How Qonto Reduced Support Tickets by 65% with Tandem

Qonto is Europe's leading business banking solution, serving over 500,000 companies. As they rapidly scaled, their support team faced an overwhelming challenge: maintaining high-quality customer service while user growth accelerated.

## The Challenge

### Explosive Growth, Mounting Pressure

Qonto's success created new problems:

- **10,000+ monthly support tickets** from users struggling with features
- **24-hour average response time** for common questions
- **Complex product** with banking, invoicing, and expense management features
- **Multiple user personas** - founders, accountants, and employees with different needs
- **High acquisition costs** being undermined by poor onboarding

The support team was drowning in repetitive questions:
- "How do I add a new team member?"
- "Where can I export my transactions?"
- "What's the difference between these account types?"
- "Why was my transfer declined?"

### Traditional Solutions Weren't Working

Qonto tried conventional approaches:
- **Expanded help center** - Users didn't read it
- **Email onboarding sequences** - Low engagement
- **Product tours** - Interrupted workflows and were quickly dismissed
- **Hiring more support agents** - Expensive and didn't scale

They needed a different approach.

## The Tandem Solution

Qonto partnered with Tandem to implement a native AI copilot that would:

1. **Live inside the product** - No switching to external help resources
2. **Understand context** - Know what users are trying to accomplish
3. **Provide instant answers** - No waiting for support agents
4. **Guide task completion** - Help users succeed, not just explain features

### Implementation Timeline

**Week 1-2**: Integration
- Connected Tandem to Qonto's frontend
- Trained AI on product documentation
- Configured permissions and security

**Week 3-4**: Knowledge Base

- Added common workflows
- Refined responses based on support ticket history

**Week 5-6**: Beta Testing

**Week 7-8**: Full Rollout
- Launched to all users

## The Results

## What Made It Work

### 1. Truly Native Integration

Tandem wasn't a chatbot widget—it was embedded throughout Qonto's interface:
- Inline help in forms and settings
- Proactive suggestions during key workflows
- Context-aware responses based on user state
- Natural language search across the product

### 2. Personalization at Scale

The AI copilot adapted to different user types:
- **Founders** saw strategic guidance on financial management
- **Accountants** received detailed explanations of banking features
- **Employees** got simple explanations for expense submission

### 3. Continuous Learning

Tandem improved over time by:
- Analyzing which responses helped users succeed
- Identifying knowledge gaps
- Learning from support escalations
- Incorporating product updates automatically

### 4. Seamless Handoff

When issues required human support:
- Copilot provided context to support agents
- Users didn't need to repeat themselves
- Resolution time decreased by 40%

## Key Takeaways

Pierre, VP of Product at Qonto, shared:

> "Tandem transformed how our users experience the product. Instead of feeling lost and reaching out to support, they get instant, contextual help right when they need it. It's like giving every user a personal banking expert who's always available."

### Lessons Learned

1. **Start with high-friction areas** - Qonto focused on onboarding and setup first
2. **Invest in knowledge quality** - Accurate responses build trust
3. **Measure everything** - Data-driven iteration leads to better outcomes
4. **Think beyond support** - AI guidance improves the entire product experience

## The Broader Impact

Beyond support deflection, Tandem enabled Qonto to:

### Scale Globally
Launch in new countries without proportionally scaling support teams in each language.

### Ship Faster
Product teams could release features knowing users would have guidance, reducing launch friction.

### Understand Users Better
AI interaction data revealed which features caused confusion and needed redesign.

### Improve Competitive Position
Superior user experience became a key differentiator in the crowded fintech market.

## What's Next

Qonto continues to expand their AI copilot capabilities:
- **Predictive assistance** - Anticipate user needs before they ask
- **Advanced automation** - Complete repetitive tasks automatically
- **Personalized recommendations** - Suggest features based on usage patterns
- **Multi-language expansion** - Support users in their native language

## Ready to Transform Your User Experience?

If you're facing similar challenges—growing support volume, complex product, or poor onboarding—AI copilots might be the solution.

Qonto's success demonstrates that native AI guidance isn't just about deflecting tickets. It's about fundamentally improving how users experience and derive value from your product.

The companies that win in the AI era won't just have AI features—they'll have AI-native experiences that make users more successful.
