# Reducing Support Tickets by 70% with AI-Powered Guidance

Support teams are overwhelmed. As products become more complex, users need more help—but scaling human support is expensive and slow. The solution isn't hiring more support agents; it's preventing tickets from being created in the first place.

## The Support Ticket Problem

Most support tickets fall into predictable categories:

- **How-to questions** - "How do I export my data?"
- **Feature discovery** - "Does your product have X capability?"
- **Setup assistance** - "I'm stuck on this configuration step"
- **Error troubleshooting** - "Why isn't this working?"

These questions are repetitive, time-consuming, and frustrating for both users and support teams. Traditional solutions like help centers and chatbots have tried to address this, but they often create more friction than they solve.

## Why Traditional Solutions Fall Short

### Help Centers and Documentation
Users have to leave the product to search for answers, disrupting their workflow. Even when they find relevant articles, the information may not match their specific context.

### Chatbots
Rule-based chatbots frustrate users with rigid conversation flows. They can't understand nuanced questions or provide contextual guidance based on what users are actually trying to accomplish.

### Tooltips and Tours
Static onboarding tours show information at the wrong time. By the time users need help with a specific feature, they've forgotten the tooltip they saw during setup.

## The AI Copilot Approach

Native AI copilots solve the support ticket problem by:

### 1. Proactive Guidance
Instead of waiting for users to get stuck and create tickets, AI copilots detect when users might need help and offer assistance proactively. If a user is hovering over a feature or seems confused, the copilot can step in.

### 2. Contextual Understanding
AI copilots understand the user's current context—what page they're on, what they're trying to do, their role, and their history with the product. This allows them to provide precisely relevant answers.

### 3. Natural Language Processing
Users can ask questions in their own words without needing to know exact terminology. "How do I get my reports into Excel?" is understood just as well as "data export functionality."

### 4. Task Completion
Beyond answering questions, AI copilots can actually help complete tasks—walking users through multi-step processes, filling forms, or configuring settings.

## Real-World Results

Companies implementing native AI copilots are seeing dramatic improvements:

- **70% average ticket deflection** - Most common questions are resolved without human intervention
- **90% user satisfaction** - Users prefer instant, contextual help over waiting for support
- **3x faster resolution** - Even complex issues are resolved more quickly
- **Lower costs** - Support teams can focus on high-value interactions instead of repetitive questions

## Case Study: SaaS Platform

A B2B SaaS company with 500,000 users was drowning in support tickets. After implementing Tandem:

- Support tickets dropped from 5,000/month to 1,500/month
- Average resolution time decreased from 24 hours to instant for deflected tickets
- Customer satisfaction scores increased by 35%
- Support team was able to focus on product feedback and strategic initiatives

## Getting Started

To reduce support volume with AI copilots:

1. **Identify common ticket categories** - What questions come up repeatedly?
2. **Implement native guidance** - Deploy an AI copilot that lives in your product
3. **Train on your product** - Ensure the AI understands your features and workflows
4. **Monitor and iterate** - Track deflection rates and continuously improve

## The Future of Support

The best support ticket is the one that never gets created. By empowering users to find answers and complete tasks independently, AI copilots create a better experience for everyone:

- **Users** get instant help without leaving their workflow
- **Support teams** focus on complex, high-value interactions
- **Product teams** gain insights into where users struggle

If your support team is overwhelmed, it's time to explore AI-native guidance solutions.
